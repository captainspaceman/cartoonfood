<h1>PRODUCT OPTIMIZATION - TRUECAR</h1>

<aside class="example">
    <h5><strong>The Problem:</strong></h5>
    <h5>Users are complaining that sign-up takes too long and they are creating accounts en masse without really knowing what they are signing up for. </h5>
    <h5><strong>The Job:</strong></h5>
    <h5>Audit the registration on-boarding experience. Identify <mark class="blue">opportunities for improvement.</mark> Come up with a content strategy and testing plan to make those improvements.
      Then, Rewrite, redesign and reorganize the information architecture of TrueCar’s onboarding flow for optimal UX and conversion.</h5>
      <h6><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> TrueCar is my current home, and the place is awesome. They (we?) are also a publicly traded company. So, for the sake of this case study, the KPI's are somewhat "academic" in nature.</h6>

</aside>

<p>When applied to the right spot (at the right time) even minor changes can have a huge impact on conversion—good or bad.</p>

<p>The first step in our testing process was to dive into the analytics and identify an opportunity. A so-called "friction point."</p>

<p>When we looked at visitor data, we identified that a lot users were dropping off when they reached a specific "next steps" confirmation page.</p>

<p>This page required a user to review their chosen car, click a terms and conditions agreement radio button and then a CTA.</p>

<img src="img/tc/next-steps.png">

<p>Prior to this screen, the users had already entered their name, email address, chosen a password and entered their address and phone number. So, in theory, there should have been very little attrition on this page as it wasn't asking the users to input any information. All we were asking was that they click a button. </p>

<p>The fallout represented a significant opportunity to increase throughput of the entire experience. </p>

        <aside class="example">

                <h5><strong>Our hypothesis:</strong></h5>

                <p>The car and pricing information wasn't good enough. It didn't represent the full benefits of signing up well enough to encourage users to complete registration. So we set about redesigning the page to bring this information to the user's attention in a more efficient manner. </p>

                <h5><strong>What we did:</strong></h5>
                <p>We redesigned and rewrote the homepage and subsequent pages in the experience
                  to emphasize the benefit of what you get when you sign-up with TrueCar.</p>

                  <p>We split up the onboarding process and reduced ten modals in the core registration flow down to five.</p>

                  <p>We optimized the core registration flow for conversion potential as well as for clarity of information.</p>

<img src="img/tc/the-grid.png">

<p>The next step was to run an A/B test of the current control page versus this new challenger redesign. To speed up the development process, we used Optimizely to make the changes to the page.</p>

<section class="article">
<p>This test showed immediate improvement in favor of the new design and message. We were able to determine with 99% statistical significance that we had improved the conversion rate by over 7%.</p>

            <aside class="example">

                        <h5><strong>The Results:</strong></h5>

                            <h5><mark class="blue">12%</mark> increase in page-to-page conversion</h5>
                            <h5><mark class="blue">7%</mark> increase in overall conversion</h5>
                            <h5><mark class="blue">2%</mark> increase in overall net funnel efficiency</h5>
